# Scrolling Experiments on the ZX Spectrum

This repo initially contained my thoughts and code for a vertical scroller
game for the ZX Spectrum: some design notes, example code, etc.  It has
since become my global repository for all my scrolling-related experiments
on the ZX Spectrum:

- Horizontal and vertical scroll routines in assembler
- SP1 vertical scrolling demos, with several optimization algorithms
- SP1 multidirectional scrolling demos
- Documentation and articles on all the previous topics
